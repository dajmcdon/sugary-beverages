# Introduction

Strong evidence has linked habitual intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with weight gain and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer @Malik2022. Pathological mechanisms include additional liquid calories in the diet, an exacerbated increase in blood insulin levels, and possibly the activation of a reward system related to sugar addiction. Multiple policy interventions to inhibit consumption of SSBs have been proposed @Krieger2021. These include taxation of SSBs, limitation of access to SSBs in schools and healthcare facilities, and package labelling systems to provide the necessary information for consumers who favour a healthier diet. As new potential interventions arise, there is a growing need for strong evidence of their efficacy.

In this context, the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of five interventions intended to shift consumer behaviour toward zero-calorie beverages. Three information-based interventions were implemented as posters, flyers, and signs providing information about caloric content in sugared beverages, the amount of time one would need to spend on a treadmill to burn such calories, or both. Two financial interventions were implemented as either a 10% discount on zero-calorie beverages or the same discount plus an informative message about the reason for the discount. Over 30 weeks, investigators alternated interventions in the cafeterias and convenience shops from three different sites (hospitals). Baseline and washout periods were implemented between intervention periods as well. Outcomes include daily sales of bottled sugared beverages and zero-calorie beverages.

Given the above study design, the main statistical question is whether the intervention groups are associated with differences in the average proportion of daily sales of zero-calorie beverages. Other statistical questions include whether there is a significant interaction between intervention and site effects, and whether groups with combined interventions had stronger effects as compared to isolated interventions (e.g., discount+messaging versus discount alone).

# Data Description and Summaries

# Exploratory Analysis

Exploratory data analysis can visualize relationships among variables, and informally give some insight on what results can be expected. Based on the data and statistical questions, we recommend the following figures and tables:

1.  Side-by-side boxplots of **\[ZERO SUGAR RESPONSE\]** by site can help identify if there are differences between sites

2.  Plots of **\[ZERO SUGAR RESPONSE\]** over time, stratified by other variables, such as intervention can identify and trends or patterns or differences between interventions.

3.  A scatterplot of zero-sugar vs sugary drink sales be used to investigate what kind of relationship they have.

Additionally, summary statistics such as means can be calculated for different variables, such as days of the week to give a numeric measure that can be compared.

# Formal Analysis

In this study, an effective treatment will increase the proportion of daily sales that come from zero-calorie beverages among sales that are either zero-calorie beverages or sugary beverages. This proportion increases when an intervention leads to relatively more sales of zero-calorie beverages than of sugary beverages. This avoids the need to perform two separate analyses (one for zero-calorie and another one for sugary beverages) and avoids variation due to sales of other unrelated products.

In light of the above reasoning, the recommended primary analysis is based on a linear regression model. The outcome is defined as the counts of zero-calorie beverage sales divided by the total sales of zero-calorie or sugary beverages (i.e. the proportion of zero-calorie beverage sales). The main variable of interest are intervention indicators, treating the baseline periods as the reference. Covariates in the model include the site, the days of the week, and the study day. Treated as a continuous variable, study day may be modelled non-linearly using splines. Finally, to assess whether intervention effects differ by site, we recommend testing interaction effects between sites and intervention groups.
